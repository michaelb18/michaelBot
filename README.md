Wow! that took a really long time and now everything is different!

Finally got also_michaelBot v2 done and it no longer uses any ML. It's starting league play soon, and I'll post here hopefully before Lightfall(the next major RLBot tournament).

Changes for the new bot entering league play:
* The new bot and the one currently in this repo share no code.
* The new bot no longer uses ML, but it still (pretty much)stateless like this one is
* The new bot uses hardcoded path planning, but this bot uses ML to approximate path planning
* The new bot has no rendering
* The new bot has a different kickoff

Why these changes occur:
* The new bot defeated more opponents in test runs than this one did.
* The new bot has better dribbling mechanics and ball control
* The new bot takes more shots than this bot does
* The new bot has more accurate shots that this one does
