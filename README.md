Wow! that took a really long time and now everything is different!

Finally got also_michaelBot v2 done and it no longer uses any ML.

Changes for the new bot entering league play:
* The new bot and the one currently in this repo share no code.
* The new bot no longer uses ML, but it still (pretty much)stateless like this one is
* The new bot has no rendering
* The new bot has a different kickoff

Why these changes occur:
* The new bot defeated more opponents in test runs than this one did.
* The new bot has better dribbling mechanics and ball control
* The new bot takes more shots than this bot does
* The new bot has more accurate shots that this one does

Tournaments competed in:

- RLBot Lightfall: 5th place

- Ultimate Battle League - Team LulW: Qualified for top 8 league play. Didn't make playoffs :(

- RLBot Championship 2020: Eliminated in Round Robin.

# New Bot Tool coming here in the coming months! About 1/3 of the way done!
